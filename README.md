Integration tests for any website
=================================

## Problem

I was trying to test that a site I was deploying was being deployed correctly.
I created this test runner to run integration tests to verify things were not
breaking.

## Setup

In order to setup the environment just run the following command:

```
    bin/setup
```

## Using

In order to run tests just run the following command

```
    rspec
```

## Dependencies

There are some dependencies that need to be installed:

- Ruby
- Phantomjs
